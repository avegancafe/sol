# Private variables are not private

This project is to demonstrate the near futility of
private variables. The "privacy" of a varialble refers
to how the contracts inherited descendents absorb behavior,
and has nothing to do really with permissioning.

For an example of accessing a private variable via a script,
see the test file.
